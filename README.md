How Common is Your Birthday?
 This Visualization Might Surprise You...
 It’s baby season in America, with September the busiest month for births on average in the last two decades.
 This new version of the heatmap, which is interactive on larger screens, uses births by day from 1994 to 2014.

Some highlights:

Holidays: People generally seem to have time for baby making during their time off. Several of the most-common birth dates, in September, correspond with average conception periods around Christmas. Sept. 9 is most-common in this dataset, though other days in that month are close. Sept. 19 is second. Following a customary gestation period, many of these babies would, in theory, have been conceived on Dec. 17 and 27, respectively.

Choice: Clearly, some people choose when they have their children. While they’re making babies during the holidays, many people aren’t really having them then. The least-common birthdays in this dataset were Christmas Eve, Christmas and New Year’s Day. Dates around Thanksgiving aren’t as common. July 4 is also at the bottom of the list. Conversely, Valentine’s Day ranks relatively high, as you can see in the graphic, as are the days just before a new tax year begins.

Skewed: There are some fun patterns in this data, but the difference between your birthday — unless it’s on a truly rare day — isn’t that much different than a top date in September. There a left-tailed skewness to the data, which ranges from 6,500 births per day to more than 12,000. The median number of births per day, though, is around 11,000. The most-common day had 12,300 births, on average. More on the data distribution soon.
